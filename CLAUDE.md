# AIDevTeamForge

Spec-driven, agent-coordinated workflow framework for AI development. Generates Claude Code runtime files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`) into target projects.

## Active work — read these before starting

When picking up work mid-stream, check the repo root for active plan files. **Read the relevant plan in full before making any changes** — plans encode multi-session context that isn't in the conversation.

Currently active:

- **`CODEX-REMOVAL-PLAN.md`** — iterative removal of Codex runtime support (in progress on `feature/codex-remove`). Read it first if working on that branch, if the user mentions codex-removal / Codex drop / Claude-native cleanup, or if `git tag -l 'codex-remove/*'` shows in-progress checkpoints.

## Conventions for ongoing work

- **Plans at repo root** as `<TOPIC>-PLAN.md` for any multi-session execution work
- Each plan includes a `## Context for next session` section + per-step `## Verify` criteria + `## When resuming work` instructions
- Plans are committed alongside the work they drive — git history shows plan evolution
- Investigation/journey knowledge lives in **Obsidian** (`20 Projects/AIDevTeamForge/`)
- Execution plans + active-state context lives in **repo**

## Branch state

- `main` — current trunk (will be archived when develop-2.0 lands)
- `feature/onboard-hybrid` — R7 7-gate hybrid + R8 Claude reference state (frozen)
- `feature/codex-remove` — current work, removing Codex runtime support
- `archive/r11-investigation` — tag on `feature/onboard-memo-first`, preserves R9+R10 Codex hardening as historical artifact (do NOT cherry-pick from this; it was Codex-specific)
- R-run evidence preserved in `testParity` and `testParity-codex` linked-worktree branches (`claude-parity-run4/run5`, `codex-parity-run4/run5`)

## Where to find what

| Topic | Location |
|---|---|
| Forge architecture decisions | `DEVELOPMENT-STATUS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` |
| Spec sources | `src/commands/`, `src/agents/`, `src/files/` |
| Generators / emitters | `scripts/emitters/`, `scripts/generate*.py`, `scripts/generate.sh` |
| Helper for `/onboard` | `scripts/lib/onboard_helper.py` |
| Install / update logic | `install.sh`, `update.sh` |
| Investigation rationale | Obsidian: `20 Projects/AIDevTeamForge/` |

## Working process for all changes

**Apply to every change, not just complex ones.** Even apparently-mechanical changes (typo fixes, single-line edits, "do exactly X" instructions) go through this flow because the user's actual goal lives in their head — what looks fully specified to you may have implicit context you haven't surfaced. Friction up, surprise down.

For every change:

1. **Draft a plan first** — break the work into small steps. Each step should leave the system in a buildable, verifiable state. For a one-line change, the "plan" is a one-line confirmation: *"I'll change `<file>:<line>` from `<X>` to `<Y>` — confirm?"* That counts.
2. **Draft each step explicitly** — what files change, what the verification looks like, how it depends on prior steps.
3. **Argue every step** — give reasoning for why this step exists, what alternatives you considered, why this approach over others. Push back on the user's framing where you have substance to add. Don't rubber-stamp; engage with the trade-offs.
4. **Align with prior work** — every step must follow logically from the previous step. No logical gaps. No hallucinated assumptions about files, branches, commits, or state that you haven't verified. Read the actual code/files before making claims about what's there.
5. **Select the best option** — when alternatives exist, present them, recommend one, explain the trade-offs. Let the user redirect if they prefer a different path.
6. **Implement only after alignment** — once the user confirms, execute. End result of each step must be straightforward and independently verifiable.

The goal is that the user can challenge or redirect at any planning point before code lands. Implementation surprises are a process failure. **One extra exchange per change is the price of staying aligned.**

## Audit format

When asked for an audit, review, or critical evaluation:

1. **Count first** — state how many findings you have before presenting any. Example: *"I found 4 findings: 1 high, 2 medium, 1 nit."*
2. **One finding at a time** — present each finding individually. Wait for user reaction before the next.
3. **Per-finding format:**
   - **Severity** — high / medium / low / nit
   - **Location** — `file:line`, branch name, commit SHA, or section reference (be specific enough to navigate to)
   - **Issue** — what's wrong (concrete, not vague)
   - **Why it matters** — actual impact, not theoretical risk
   - **Fix** — specific suggestion, not "consider doing X"
4. **Wait for user reaction** — they reply with one of: **fix** (apply the suggested fix), **defer** (note for later, don't fix now), **skip** (not a real issue, move on), **discuss** (engage further before deciding)
5. After their reaction, move to the next finding. Repeat until all are addressed.

Don't batch findings into a single wall of text. Don't recommend without explaining. Don't proceed to the next finding before the user has reacted to the current one.
